# JS Async Recap

A Promise is simply an object in JS. Has three states: _pending_, _fulfilled_ and _rejected_. The **Promise** is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an async operation and it's value. The **Await** operator is used to wait for a _Promise_. It can be used with function with the **Async** keyword.
